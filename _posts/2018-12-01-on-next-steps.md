title: On Next Steps

Endgame. The light at the end of the tunnel. Whatever you want to call it, the ultimate goal of doing a Ph.D. is being done with doing a Ph.D. At some point you will have completed your requirements, left for other opportunities, etc. But the point of a Ph.D. program is that it is inherently transitional.<br />
<br />
I bring all this up because I now know what I'll be doing once I finish mine. I got a job offer for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position, which I promptly accepted. The job checked a lot of the boxes my wife and I had set up for our future, and without going into too many details it was the job that I really wanted when I started this whole job search.<br />
<br />
In an earlier post I talked about milestones as key metrics for measuring progress during a Ph.D. I recently passed my thesis proposal defense, one of those key milestones where your committee approves your topic. In my field, the proposal is a bit more along the lines of "you're ready to graduate pretty soon." We do our proposal fairly late in the game, and often defend within a year of that. The next big milestone is definitely the "I got a job" milestone. Having a job in hand does two things: 1. it motivates you to get out and get working, and 2. it sends a signal to your advisor/committee that some external individual has deemed you worthy of Ph.D.-grad-level work, so maybe you aren't as hopeless a cause as earlier thought. With a job in hand, particularly a faculty position, you can see that the light at the end of the tunnel isn't way far away, but just down the road a little.<br />
<br />
So here's to getting wrapped up with this degree and getting to work!
