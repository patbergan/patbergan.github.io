In our house time seems to be a hot commodity. My wife works a full-time job, I have my research assistantship obligations plus my own research, and of course we have our little girl to take care of and baby #2 on the way. Lots going on, and never enough time to do all of it. One thing that I found was slipping was my reading. I love to read, but with so much always going on I struggled to find time to read every week (let alone every day). First, I tried reading before bed, but I was always too tired to actually read anything before bed. So, I did something that past me would never have approved: set my alarm one hour earlier. And turns out, it worked!<br />
<br />
Waking up earlier is a popular idea for getting more done in a day. But a lot of it seems to focus on waking up earlier to be more productive. But for me, I use that early time to keep up with one of my hobbies. Starting the day with a book (particularly one that I don't have to read) is a nice way to start the day before my daughter wakes up. I get an hour or so to myself to sit with a cup of coffee and really have some time to myself. Every once in a while I'm tempted to make that time productive, but I think that keeping it as hobby time is a great way to make sure I stay on track and keep getting up when that alarm goes off extra early. If that time turns into work time, I'll start dreading it, then I'll be less likely to get out of bed when the alarm goes off.
