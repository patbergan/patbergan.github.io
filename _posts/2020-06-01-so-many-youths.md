title: So Many Youths

<div>We have three kids now. Three. We are officially past man-to-man and into zone. After a few months I've learned a few things, so I thought I'd write about them. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>1. Head on a swivel</div><div><br /></div><div>Even though baby #3 is stationary, it feels like there is constant motion at the house these days. If one kid is still, then the other is moving at full speed. Or both of the older two are moving, of course in opposite directions of each other. Or, more often than I'd like, directly at each other. Just the mere fact of keeping track of everything that is going on has become that much more difficult, usually because I can't be moving as well. I gotta watch the baby! <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>2. Relax</div><div><br /></div><div>With all of the new chaos, I've realized that I don't need to rise to the occasion with excessive worrying. Me upping my anxiety to match the new levels of madness does no good for anyone. I should instead trust the kids to play well together (most of the time) and let them explore. I do have to note that this realization is mostly theoretical, as I am still way too anxious. But I'm working on it!</div><div><br /></div><div>3. Life is more fun</div><div><br /></div><div>Sounds weird, right? But we get to watch baby 3 grow and develop while watching our older girls bloom into young women. Our oldest starts preschool soon, which is crazy! But among all of the changes and worries and new cuts and bruises, I don't think I'd have it any other way. <br /></div>
