title: Making the most of a long commute
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/07/making-most-of-long-commute.html)*.

A major part of my Ph.D. program has been summer internships. I've had some great opportunities to work on really cool projects and make some extra money during my summers. This summer, due to a number of logistical reasons, my internship office is quite far away from our house. Like about 2 hours away. So that means long commutes, but if you're as sunny and optimistic as I most certainly am not, they you're probably thinking to yourself, "That sounds like a great time to <i>do something. </i>What that <i>something </i>is I don't know, maybe Dad, Ph.D. can enlighten me." You're asking a lot of me, Reader, but what I can do is tell you what I've done to avoid listening to songs on the radio for 30 minutes and commercials on the radio/static for an hour and a half each morning and evening.<br />
<h2>
Listen to podcasts</h2>
I love podcasts. You can choose exactly what you want to listen to, you can skip episodes you don't want to hear, and you can replay your favorites. Depending on the podcast the ad breaks are limited and (compared to radio) very short. Podcasts are a great option if you're daily commute is in the Medium to Large range, but I've found that with my XL commute, I've both a) caught up with new episodes of my favorite podcasts and b) felt myself looking for something more meaty.<br />
<br />
Three of my favorite podcasts are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/" target="_blank">The Art of Manliness</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/" target="_blank">Planet Money</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://freakonomics.com/archive/" target="_blank">Freakonomics</a>.<br />
<h2>
Listen to a book</h2>
I have to admit, I am a new convert to audiobooks, but I will sing their praises from the hills forever after. With the long commute, I found myself running out of podcasts to listen to. One option for me was to go and find new podcasts to listen to, but that wasn't appealing because I would be in the same situation once I got through those episodes, and I didn't want to go find a new podcast just for the sake of it. I wanted to take advantage of these long chunks of each day where I could really listen closely to something. Enter audiobooks.<br />
<br />
I had tried audiobooks in the past with an Audible subscription, but it didn't stick because at the time I didn't have any long driving. I would try to listen to books on 15 to 30 minute increments on the train or on a walk, and that just wasn't doing it for me. And an Audible subscription also wasn't my first choice, being a grad student with a growing family and all.<br />
<br />
Luckily enough for me,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.overdrive.com/" target="_blank">Overdrive</a>&nbsp;exists. With Overdrive, you can use your public library card to borrow, download, and listen to audiobooks for free! Free is good. And they even have ebooks that you can download and read as well. One comment about Overdrive is that the catalog of books that they have available is based on your library system, and it works just like your library. If you want a book that's checked out, you have to get in line. I will say; however, that this setup has exposed me a huge number of audiobooks that I would have never listened to, and certainly never have read, if it wasn't one of the available audiobooks. I've learned about myself that I really like to listen to nonfiction during my commute, in particular biographies and books about early America. Who knew??<br />
<h2>
Dictation</h2>
This one felt a bit weird to me at first. Talking aloud to myself is something I actually do quite frequently, but I never <i>record</i>&nbsp;what it is that I'm saying. But with so much time on the road, I wanted to see if I could create something instead of just taking in my podcasts and audiobooks. So when I got into my car I opened up Google Docs, hit the little speech-to-text microphone on my phone's keyboard, and just...talked. And when I was done, the first draft of a&nbsp;<a href="http://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/06/parenting-with-probability.html" target="_blank">recent post</a>&nbsp;was complete! In a fairly short amount of time (about 20 minutes if I recall correctly) I was able to dictate the first draft of a 1200-word blog post. I have to admit, I've only done this once (partially because the Google Docs setup was a bit too clunky to keep up on the road and partially because I've been listening to some great books that I don't want to pause), but this was an interesting surprise for me and a creative way to pass some of the commute time.<br />
<h2>
Call someone</h2>
OK, stick with me here for a second. One of the best things you can do with these stretches of time, something that will help you and those closest to you is to...call someone on the telephone. Believe it or not, those social media and email devices you have in your pockets will also allow you to speak words into them that someone on the other side of the country can hear and reply to! Technology is a beautiful thing.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, our family moved so that I could do my Ph.D., so we don't have any relatives nearby. And when I'm at the house, there's always a lot going on that leads to not talking to my parents for a while. It's really nice to give my parents or my brother a call during a long drive home and just...talk. I can catch up with them, with what's going on in my hometown, and even make plans for the next time they are coming for a visit, or we are going to visit them.<br />
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
These are my tips for making the most of long commutes. Listening to podcasts or books gives you a chance to control your input and avoid radio ads/static. Dictation lets you create something instead of just consuming more content. And giving someone a call on the phone is a great way to catch up with loved ones when you have a block of time that you know you'll be free for. Hopefully one or more of these help you get through your long commute!
