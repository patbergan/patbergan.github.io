title: On Running it Backwards
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2020/04/on-running-it-backwards.html)*.

As I mentioned a few posts back, I got things a bit backwards when it came to wrapping up my Ph.D. I got a job offer before I graduated, which was great and exactly what I should have done. But I started that job before my dissertation was completed and defended. This cause some headaches and some conversations with my advisor, but now that it's all past me I think in hindsight it went well. While there was a lot of stress involved in preparing to teach a class, getting involved with a new department, and moving to a new state, all while still wrapping up a dissertation(!), there were some positives too. Let's focus on them.<br />
<br />
First, getting and accepting a job offer took a huge weight off of my shoulders. I really mean huge. Going into the job search I was very unsure about my prospects, partially because I was applying maybe a year early, so my application wasn't as good as it could have been. That said, the job I got was not the job that I expected, but is absolutely a job that I very much wanted. So all in all it worked out, and the stress of "will I get a job?", "will I get an interview?", "will someone call me to yell at me for wasting their time with an obviously under-qualified application?" all went away. I could check "Get a job" off of my list, and really focus the end of my time as a Ph.D. student on my dissertation instead of juggling two very important to-dos.<br />
<br />
Second, once I started in my new position, I had things to do! I couldn't just sit and stare at a blank page of dissertation and hope that words would appear. If I wanted to get my new work and my old work done I had to, you know, do it. By adding the additional demands of my faculty position on top of the work needed to get my dissertation out the door, I was able to focus, prioritize, and make regular progress instead of in fits and bursts.<br />
<br />
Finally, and this is a much less practical one, it was cool to "go back" for my dissertation defense. By the time my defense came up I had already been teaching for a few weeks, so I was that much more comfortable with my presentation skills, answering questions, and all that good stuff. Now, that said, I was still a nervous wreck. But I was a slightly less nervous wreck, and I think that helped me a great deal.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I would recommend my path through the end of my Ph.D. to anyone, but I'm happy to say that it worked out nicely for me. There were stressful bits, exciting bits, and a lot of writing sessions, but when it was all said and done I successfully defended. Coming to the end of this academic year and looking back on the craziness, it's hard to imagine another year that has as much stress baked in. First class, dissertation defense, moving, new baby. It was a lot. But it was awesome.
