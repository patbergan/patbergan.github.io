<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>We are about a week and a half into Lent, where Christians prepare for Jesus's death and resurrection. It is supposed to be a time of reflection and often giving something up. Usually around Lent I'll make a decision to give something up, but I usually don't spend as much time reflecting on Lent and what it means as I should. This year, due to some interesting chance circumstances (see the double meaning in the title? Eh? EH?) the Dad Ph.D. family is taking part in a larger effort to really make Lent count. I mentioned Best Lent Ever in my last post,
 but I didn't explain how I discovered it.</p>

<h1>A Bad Fat Tuesday</h1>

<p>This year Ash Wednesday was on the same day as Valentine's Day. I don't recall that happening recently, so Fat Tuesday was really interesting. In particular, I was having a pretty rough day. I had just gotten some pretty harsh reviews back for a manuscript that we had submitted, and coupled with some other experiments that weren't going well, I was in a bit of a mood. I wasn't up for celebrating Fat Tuesday, and I still had to prepare for Valentine's Day with the Mrs. So there was a lot going on and I really wasn't feeling up for it.</p>

<h1>Ash Wednesday</h1>

<p>Fast-forward a day. For Ash Wednesday, I planned on attending Mass on campus at lunchtime. However because of a last minute meeting change, I ended up going earlier in the day. After Mass there was an announcement that they were giving away free books to read and reflect on during Lent. I love books, and I love things that are free, so needless to say I went and grabbed a book. That book was written by Matthew Kelly, the founder of an organization called Dynamic Catholic. On the back of the book was a link to something called "Best Lent Ever." Every Lent, Dynamic Catholic puts out daily video reflections, as well as guided readings through one of Kelly's books and daily prayers. As soon as I saw it I thought that this would be a great chance to make Lent more than the usual "give something up then don't think about it until Easter." This Lent our family is going to be proactive. We'll be watching the videos and discussing them daily, as well as reflecting on them individually.</p>

<h1>Best Lent Ever?</h1>

<p>I'm writing this down here because it was a complete accident that I stumbled upon Best Lent Ever and Dynamic Catholic. I could have gone to Ash Wednesday mass at our local parish and would have never seen the free book that led me to Dynamic Catholic's website. So far the daily reflections have been great. They've really helped me reflect on myself, on Lent, and on goals I've set for me and my family. We'll see if this turns out to truly be our Best Lent Ever, but I'm excited about a Lent where we really reflect on what these 40 days mean.</p>
