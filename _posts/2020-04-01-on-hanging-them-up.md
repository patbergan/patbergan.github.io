title: On Hanging Them Up
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2020/04/on-hanging-them-up.html)*.

This post is going to seem like a curveball, but I have an announcement: I am officially a retired athlete.<br />
<br />
"What's that?" you say. "I thought you were a professor or something. I'm now very confused and not exactly sure where I am."<br />
<br />
Let me explain. I'll try to do so while keeping the vague anonymity that this site is going for, so bear with me.<br />
<br />
When I was in college I played rugby. I was pretty good. My team was nationally ranked at one point, and I was the captain of that team. I made a few appearances for the USA under-19 team, and was selected for different all-conference teams during my four years. After college I played for some men's teams that were competitive in the top men's division. When all of this was going on, though, the prospects for high-performance rugby involved going overseas. The top division in the US was amateur, and competition was inconsistent around the country. If you wanted to make the national team you had to go abroad to hone your skills in a professional rugby environment. Either that or move in the US to one of a few cities to play with one of the elite teams in the US. This strategy at the time was riskier than going abroad.<br />
<br />
So, when I was thinking about the future, as one does, I saw three very important aspects of it: my family, my career, and rugby. At the time I was dating my wife. I figured that two of the three could happen: commit to my wife and my career at the expense of rugby, or commit to my wife and rugby, and drag her around the world to chase a dream. As you can tell, the other 2 out of 3 was decidedly not an option.<br />
<br />
To make a long story a bit shorter, rugby is what got dropped. Especially when I started my Ph.D., I just couldn't realistically continue playing without sacrificing something else. But in the back of my mind I still had this thought that if I wanted to, and if we as a family talked about it, I could flip a switch and pull rugby, specifically high-level rugby, back into the mix. In the last few years, with a pro league in the US, this thought has taken up more space in my mind. "I could do it." "I'm only a few months away from being in game form." Things like this have been popping up in my head more and more recently. And it's been having a negative impact on me.<br />
<br />
Fitness-wise, I'm out of shape, but I'm working on it. But there is a big difference between "I need to be in shape because I want to be healthy for my family" and "I need to be in shape for 80 minute rugby matches in a pro league." This is probably obvious to you. But with the tickling in my mind about possible pro rugby glory, I thought more about the latter than the former.<br />
<br />
By "retiring" I'm removing pro rugby from my list of (admittedly highly unlikely) goals. My future with rugby, and sports more generally, is as a coach, fan, data messer, and social athlete (my 20 year old self would kick me if he heard himself utter the phrase "social athlete"). And that is fine. It's better than fine. It's great. Because it is where I'm at, and it's a place where my whole family can enjoy sports together. I am so excited to share rugby with my daughters when they're older, and help them learn whatever sports they are drawn to as well.
