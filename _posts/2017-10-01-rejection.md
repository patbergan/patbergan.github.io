title: Rejection

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2017/10/rejection.html)*.

Doing research involves a lot of rejection. Submitting papers to conferences means that you're going up against a 20-40% acceptance rate. So 60-80% of the papers are getting rejected. Applying for grants is tougher odds. Even if you think your work is top notch, there's always a chance that the reviewers disagree.<br />
<br />
In my (short so far) research career, I've had my fair share of rejections. Papers have been rejected from conferences, and I've had a grant rejected <b>twice</b>. Not to mention the rejections from all of the Ph.D. programs that I didn't get into. So yeah, they're been piling up. In all fairness I have gotten some really sweet acceptances so far, which are amazing.<br />
<br />
So what do you do? How do you deal with rejection after rejection? I try not to take them seriously (emphasis on the try). Each rejection comes with comments from the reviewers so I have an opportunity to see where there was a disconnect between what I thought was great work and what the reviewers saw as maybe not so great. But staying positive in a situation like this is easier said than done.<br />
<br />
Enter my amazing wife and my beautiful baby. Since our little lady was born, she's been my secret weapon to combat rejections. When I get that email with the "Unfortunately..." beginning, I can always go to her and get a smile. It doesn't sound like much but so far it's been exactly what I need in those situations. And of course my wife is great too. She'll know beforehand because I'll be checking my email relentlessly, so when I get quite or suddenly stop checking email, she's there with a hug and some words of encouragement. She's the best.<br />
<br />
So my secret weapon against rejection is my family. What's yours?
