*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2020/04/back-at-it.html)*.

After a long (over a year!) hiatus, we're back! In all honesty I don't have a good reason for the gap. I just wasn't writing here during that time. But with everything going on now I figured now was a good time to get this started up again.<br />
<br />
What has been going on since I last wrote on March 29, 2019? Well, quite a bit:<br />
<br />
1. Our family up and moved from where I was doing my Ph.D. to where my new Assistant Professor position is located. We visited houses, fell in love with one, and bought it.<br />
2. I started my new job! I am now an official tenure-track Assistant Professor.<br />
3. I defended my dissertation and got my Ph.D. It's actually still a little shocking that it is done but it is done!<br />
<br />
I'll note that in the ordering above 2 is ahead of 3 chronologically. Starting my new job before finishing my Ph.D. defense led to a few logistical considerations (putting it mildly) that are worth their own posts.<br />
<br />
Oh, and most recently:<br />
<br />
4. We had another baby! My wife and I now have 3 beautiful girls.<br />
<br />
So, lots going on. And lots to write about. Plenty of material for a new batch of blog posts!
