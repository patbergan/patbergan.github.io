title: 'Traveling Part 1: I miss my family!'

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2017/11/traveling-part-1-i-miss-my-family.html)*.

When you do research, one expectation is that you present that research to your peers. In my field, that involves traveling to conferences and presenting either a talk or a poster at annual conferences. The conferences are great ways to get feedback on your work, network with other researchers in your fields, and see what everyone else is working on! But when you have a family, that travel also means 3-5 days (or more!) away from them. This traveling post is going to be a multi-parter: 2 (possibly 3) posts on my experience with academic travel, how I manage it, and how I think I can do better in the future. So without further ado, here's part 1.<br />
<h2>
Hello, Goodbye</h2>
Our daughter was late. She was born well after her due date. This led to some interesting observations that might make it to future posts, but for the purposes of this blog it had another effect: I had to leave. I was scheduled to travel to my first conference to present my first lead-author paper. I assumed that baby girl would be born on time, thus giving me 3-4 weeks at home with her and Mrs. Dad. We talked this through and agreed that that plan sounded good. Of course, it all went south when someone was tardy with her appearance. So I had a dilemma: should I stay or should I go?<br />
<br />
Long story short, we decided that I should go, but only for 2 of the 4 days. That way I could present my poster, meet with some people I needed to meet with, and be home. This involved changing flights, talking with my advisor about my travel plans (they were supportive, which was a big help). But still, that meant two days away from my wife who just gave birth and my two-week-old baby. I wasn't looking forward to that.<br />
<br />
Being at the conference was a mixed experience. On the one hand I was so excited to be presenting my research and meeting people in the field from other institutions. But the whole time I was thinking about home. How is my wife? How is our baby? We Skyped in between sessions so that I could say hey and check in. That was great for me (and hopefully for my wife), but that didn't curb the feeling that I was letting my family down somehow. Of course my wife was very supportive and wanted to hear all about the conference, while I wanted to hear all about what was going on at the house.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I think it was the right decision to attend the conference (and my wife agreed with me in hindsight). But it was hard! Not just for me but for my wife. In the next post I'll talk more about how I think parents (especially new parents) can deal with travel and ways to stay connected with your family when you're on the road.
