title: For the Greater Glory

Recently I signed up for daily reflections from Dynamic Catholic. They are usually short phrases or sentences, and are a nice way to take a minute of reflection during what may be a busy day. One reflection from the end of April really struck me: "We are not promised an easy path, or even a clear one. But we are commanded to follow and we are promised an eternal reward," (Mary Beth Weisenburger, Praying with a Pen).<br />
<br />
I love this quote, and I encountered it when I was making my way through Ben Sasse's audiobook. I think there is a really strong message: Life isn't, and probably shouldn't be, easy. There is pain, hardship, and struggle in life. And in the pain, hardship, and struggle is growth. By working hard we learn new skills and create new experiences, and by suffering hardships we learn so much about who we are, what our values are, and how we deal with adversity. In all of these things, most importantly, God is with us. At all times and in all things. To steal a line from one of my daughter's books, He has big plans for us, and He gives us big challenges. Everything we do on this earth is by His grace and for His glory. For the greater glory of God. This reflection got me thinking back to my high school days at a Jesuit high school, where the motto is ad majorem Dei gloriam (AMDG), for the greater glory of God. That motto was a huge part of my life during high school, and even as I got to college. But it hasn't been at the forefront of my life recently as it should be. The nice thing about it is it is so simple to start your day with a simple reminder: AMDG. Live today for the greater glory of God.
