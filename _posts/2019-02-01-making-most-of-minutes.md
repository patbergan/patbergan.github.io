title: Making the Most of Minutes
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2019/02/making-most-of-minutes.html)*.

I have a preferred way of working: alone, for long stretches of time. But with two kids, a house that needs to be cleaned up and put on the market, and a move to prep and plan for, it's tough sometimes to get those long stretches. And even when I do, there are always more things demanding my attention than time to get them done. On a similar, totally but not really unrelated note, when I have a few minutes of downtime in the morning or evening, or in between tasks, my first move is almost always to reach for my phone to check news or Twitter or some other distraction. Those minutes are precious, and I shouldn't waste them by wandering through the internet with no purpose. So recently I've tried to just enjoy those moments. No phone, no next thing on the to-do list that I can squeeze in. I just stop, and think, and enjoy a little bit of solitude to recharge and get ready for the day (or if it's the evening, reflect on the day and think about tomorrow). Now, I'm nowhere near reliable when it comes to this practice. I still reach for the phone on occasion. But I'm more mindful of it now, and when I catch myself, it's easier to course-correct and put the phone down.
