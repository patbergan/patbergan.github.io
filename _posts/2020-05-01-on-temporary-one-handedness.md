title: On Temporary One-handedness

<span id="docs-internal-guid-5f0fcef7-7fff-e4b5-0373-46c4628a0af0"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Having a newborn in the house is a beautiful thing. You would think with number 3 I'd have everything down, but our newest addition is full of surprises and keeps my wife and I on our toes. I'm still learning when it comes to being a dad, and that's a beautiful thing.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One thing I've learned is the ability to be grateful for my new temporary one-handedness. #3's preferred naptime location is the crook of my arm. She loves it there, especially from 5-7 am. That used to be the time when I would be up doing a few chores, reading, and making breakfast before the rest of the family woke up. With two hands. Short one appendage, I've had to improvise. No folding laundry (two hands!), no typing blog posts on the laptop (two hands! or 2 hours to peck one key out at a time). And breakfast is limited to what I can grab and handle, you guessed it, le lamh amhain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At first I was a little grumpy about trading in time to myself for time as a cot, but I've grown to appreciate it. I remember times like this with our older kids, time spent as the source of comfort that they need. It's short, but oh so sweet. Soon #3 will sleep soundly in her crib for hours (I hope), and before we know it she'll do nothing but sleep (when she isn't questioning our every decision). Until then I can cherish this time with her and adapt.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And oh how I've adapted. My one-handed skills have exploded these last 2 months. I can crack an egg with one hand. I can make a pot of coffee, or a K-cup if you're so inclined. I can read the morning paper on an app. And, going against all my instincts, I can write a blog post on my phone (big shout out to my wife who, as usual, made this suggestion that ended up being correct). In fact, this post is my first one handed production, co-written I guess by our lovely sleeping baby. It </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">will require</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> (required) significant editing, but I think it got the job done.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So hereï¿½s to you other parents pulling double duty as a piece of furniture for your newborns. The next phase of sleep for them will probably involve a lot of crying, so enjoy this while it lasts.</span></p><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></div></span>
