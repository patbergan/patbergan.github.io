title: A Fun Finals Story
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2017/12/a-fun-finals-story.html)*.

It's finals season at school, and while I don't have any since I'm mostly finished with classes, I want to share a finals story from a long, long time ago. Way back when I was an undergrad. This story is about balance, commitments, and a free t-shirt. The details will be (frustratingly) sparse to preserve some degree of anonymity.<br />
<br />
When I was an undergrad, I participated in a club sport. I was pretty good at said club sport, and was invited to be a part of the under-19 age grade team of the U.S. National team for my sport. This was, needless to say, awesome. To have a chance to play the sport I love for my country was an amazing achievement, and to this day is one of my proudest moments.<br />
<br />
Anyways, trip in question coincided with the end of a school semester. That means projects, finals, all that good stuff. The way my travel was going to work out I would return from the trip the night before the first day of finals. The airport I flew into was about 2 hours from school, and I had to bus from the airport to campus. So I was cutting it very close, but there was no way I was going to miss this chance. So I went to all of my professors and told them about the opportunity and worked out a schedule with them. Any work that I missed I could turn in when I returned (this included a take-home final that I had to do while on the trip!). The only hiccup was this one class, where I had my final on Finals Day 1. I wanted to let the professor know that there was a slight chance I'd be late for the final. You know, because of things like delays on the international flight coming home (not uncommon) or issues with the bus that goes from the airport to campus (quite common). His response was not encouraging. Basically, if I wasn't there when the test was being handed out, 0. Oh and by the way, he wanted a free t-shirt from the trip.<br />
<br />
So that was a bummer, but I figured that nothing would go wrong on the trip home and I would make it in time. I'd have to squeeze in studying during the trip (I didn't), and hope that the trip home was smooth sailing (it wasn't).<br />
<br />
My first problem was with my connecting flight. I got back into the U.S. no problem, but at my first stop there were huge delays at the airport. So I had to wait there for several hours. Ok, no problem, I'll use this time to do all of the studying that I didn't do on the trip. Once I finally got to my final (airport) destination, I encountered problem #2: since I was so late getting in, I missed the last bus for the evening to campus! The next bus was leaving early the following morning, and would get to campus 30 minutes before my exam was scheduled to start. And I thought I was cutting it close before.<br />
<br />
There was nothing I could do, so I set up shop in the airport, cracked open my textbook, and studied for several hours before sleeping for a few hours at the airport. The next morning, I jumped on the first bus, studied/slept, and when the bus arrived at campus I ran right to the exam, suitcases and equipment bag in tow. I made it with, no joke, 5 minutes to spare. I gave the professor his free t-shirt (and what I hope was a decent stink eye) and took my exam. Afterwards I went back to the dorm and collapsed for a few hours before getting back to work on my next final. Not only did I pass the exam, I got an A! Thank you, airport study time!<br />
