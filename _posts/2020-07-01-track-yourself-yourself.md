title: Track Yourself, Yourself

<div>If you are fully connected to the internet of things, and track every conceivable metric about your life, but never actually look at said metrics, are you really gaining anything? <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This question occurred to me recently as I was going for a run. I log my miles with an app, and after the run I look at the numbers and say something to the effect of "I'm slow." But before a few weeks ago that was the end of it. I would close the app and go about my day, never to re-visit those numbers. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Now, I do things a little differently. I make note of the miles in a spreadsheet. I know, I know, I can hear the shouts of "Luddite!" raining down upon me. But hear me out. You use an app to track some measurable statistics that is relevant to your life. But if you are explicit in your own marking down of that stat, a few things can happen:</div><div><br /></div><div>1. You have a record, outside of the app, of your performance on that metric over time. I can now easily see how many miles I ran recently, and at what pace I ran them, by just pulling up this spreadsheet.</div><div>2. The act of adding records to your spreadsheet takes more time than the app simply syncing your results to the cloud. And that is a good thing! You have to stop, open the spreadsheet, look at old metrics, and write down new ones. That gives you an opportunity to think more about what you are doing, why you are doing it, and how much progress you are making. For me, looking at past running times is a very easy way to feel better about my most recent run. <br /></div><div>3. Accountability. For a lot of things, an app isn't going to make you feel guilty about skipping out on a habit. But a large gap in that spreadsheet that you are supposed to be updating can really motivate you to get back on track.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I also track writing for work, and it has the same effect as my running log. I can see how many words I write, and I can see when I have gaps in my week to keep me motivated and on track. This might not be a good idea for everything that you track. For example, I&nbsp; don't have a spreadsheet going for books I've read, because Goodreads covers that well enough, and I can easily look at the books I've read this year so far. That said, if I was setting an ambitious reading goal, like X number of pages per day, I would probably have to start a new sheet on my spreadsheet.<br /></div>
