Ash Wednesday was this past Wednesday, and we are now in the season of Lent. For Catholics Lent is an important time of reflection and sacrifice to remember the suffering of Jesus, in order to prepare for the joy of the resurrection on Easter Sunday. This year my wife and I are taking part in Best Lent Ever, which 3 days in has been a great experience so far. Today's reflection was around the question "Who do you want to become?" I could answer that a hundred different ways, but for the purposes of this blog I've been thinking about how I can become a better grad student and a better researcher.<h2>
Too Much</h2>
<div>
My work as a grad student is, by the nature of it, open-ended. Research involves answering questions that have not yet been answered, or even coming up with questions that have not been asked yet. As you can imagine, there are a lot of questions to answer, and even more potential questions to ask! So far in my research career, I've struggled with putting too many projects on my plate. I have ideas that I want to pursue, and conference deadlines that I want to hit, and next thing I know I have 7 projects with "upcoming deadlines" that I'll frankly never hit. This has a tangible negative impact on my research career, as I need to publish in order to advance. So this grand plan I have doesn't materialize because I am stretching myself too thin, which means none of the projects progress according to schedule, and none of the deadlines are hit. Best case scenario, I hit a deadline, but the paper is not as good as it could (or should) be because I was rushing at the last minute to complete it. Can you guess why I would be rushing at the last minute? Because I was working on all of my other projects! So it's time for a change.</div>

As part of Lent this year, I'll be making a concerted effort to reduce the number of projects I'm working on at any given time, and use this newfound bandwidth to really focus on one or two projects that I can make great. My motto for this is going to be "One Project, One Deadline." This is going to be much easier said than done, but now is a great time to take a stab at it. My hope is that this focus will help me with other areas, such as scheduling and time management, since I'll only have one (or two) projects that I'm working on instead of 5 or 6 or more. We'll see how it goes.</div>

First up for my one and only deadline is next Thursday. This deadline is for a resubmission of a manuscript that was just rejected (see above for a potential reason why). So next week my focus will be on making improvements to that paper, strengthening the arguments for why it is important, and incorporating the comments from the last round of reviews. Wish me luck!</div>

Who do you want to become?</h2>

Being a better researcher is one half of my answer to this question. I also want to become a healthier me. But more about that next time.</div>
