title: 'Traveling Part 2: A Little Help from our Friends'
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2017/11/traveling-part-2-little-help-from-our.html)*.

In part 1 of the traveling post, I talked about my experience traveling to a research conference right after the birth of our daughter. In this post I discuss a more recent travel trip, where my wife and I needed some serious help because of a perfect storm of scheduling.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Dad, Ph.D. is a working mom. She has an awesome job with a great company. She works very hard, and has to occasionally travel for meetings and company events. These trips are rare, and usually when she travels, I'm at home, so I'm in charge at the house while she's gone. But this isn't a post about how my wife was traveling and I was home, that would be boring.<br />
<br />
Last month I had to go to a week-long conference to present some research. When I was talking to my wife about the travel (several months back), she checked her calendar and informed me that she too had to travel that exact same week. She had a huge company event on the other side of the country at the same time as my conference. Oh boy. This was a fun discussion, because this travel week would be the first time that both of us were away from our daughter for an extended period of time. Even worse, we'd be far away! We're not talking day-trip or anything like that. Both of us would be several hours away. But we knew we both had to take these trips, so we set to figuring out how to make it work.<br />
<br />
Since we were both going to be gone, our first thought for care for our daughter was her Grandmom, my mother. My parents live about 5 hours from us and my mom is recently retired, and she's in love with her granddaughter, so of course she jumped at the chance to take her for a week. That would be the end of the story normally, but this post is about <i>travel</i>, so there's another twist to add in: my parents were on vacation the week before our work travel week, and would be returning the day that my wife had to leave town for her trip. So that meant that my wife had a few hours to get our daughter to my parents' house, get her set up with my parents, and get herself on her flight to go to the work meeting.<br />
<br />
Notice how I said my wife in that last sentence and not we? So....my conference started a few days before my wife's trip, and I had to be there before my parents got back, so all of the setup, drop off, and everything else fell on my wife. That means that she had to:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Pack up herself, our daughter, and the dog</li>
<li>Drive to my parents' house (5 hours)</li>
<li>Get our daughter set up at their house, let my mom know about naps, meals, and everything else</li>
<li>Hop on a cross-country flight to a week-long work meeting</li>
</ol>
<div>
All in one day! Of course, she handled it all amazingly and the entire week went great. But this was far and away one of our most stressful weeks in our new lives as parents. My mom was great about sending pictures of our daughter being adorable, and keeping us up to date on how everything was going.&nbsp;</div>
<div>

In the future, we definitely want to avoid situations like that week. But it is really nice to know that even when travel plans conspire to pull both parents away at the same time, we can count on family to help us out!</div>
