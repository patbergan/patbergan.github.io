Our daughters are now 2 and a half and almost 8 months. First of all, I cannot believe that I just wrote that sentence. They're getting too big! But second, and more to the point of this post, I've been a dad for two and a half years so that means the world must know my morning routine. So here it is.<br />
<br />
Some background: I've learned an important fact about myself. I cannot wake up at the same time as the girls. Can't do it. I need at least 30 minutes to an hour's head start so that I can wake myself up and have a little time to myself before everyone else is awake. When I wake up, I'm groggy and grumpy and not the most pleasant person in the world. So I get up before everyone else to get that out of my system.<br />
<h4>
The Morning Routine</h4>
The night before: I know! It's not in the morning, but this is the most important step. Make a pot of coffee and set the timed brew on it for 10 minutes before my alarm will go off. This way I wake up while it's brewing and I can pour myself a cup right away when I go downstairs. This is crucial.<br />
<br />
Wake up at 4:45am. This gives me a little over an hour before our youngest wakes up. I spend the first half hour or so writing, and the rest of the time reading. More often than not, it's some kind of nonfiction biography, memoir, or business-type book. I tried to mix in textbooks every once in a while, but I have a hard time working through exercises that early in the morning.<br />
<br />
I take over with our youngest at 6 and am in charge of the girls until 8 when I start work. In that time there is a lot of play, and I also make breakfast for the three of us once our oldest wakes up (around 6:45 or 7). At 8 it's "off to work," which right now means upstairs to the computer in our bedroom. It's a nice short commute, usually not too much traffic.<br />
<br />
Having a little time before the girls are up allows me to wake myself up so I'm not groggy or grumpy when we're playing, and it also gives me a chance to spend some time reading or working on something personal. By the time the girls are up I've had time to ease into the morning so that I'm at my best for the bit of time I get to spend with them each morning.

This sounds like a great system - I'm sure your family appreciates you getting the grump out of your system before the day starts!
