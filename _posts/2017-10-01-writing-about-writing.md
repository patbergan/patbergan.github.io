title: Writing about Writing

As a Ph.D. student, there's always a lot going on. Between classes, doing research, keeping up with published results, and other obligations, there is a variety of things that need to get done on any given day. Sometimes it is hard to keep track of what should be getting done and when. I've often found myself working for hours on something that I considered to be at the top of my priority list when in fact it was a minor thing that should have just been done quickly and forgotten about.<br />
<br />
The name of the game as a Ph.D. student is <i>writing</i>. That's really it. Everything that happens over the course of a Ph.D. program should move some project closer to publication. In particular, if I want to get a job in academia after I graduate (I do) then a big part of that job application process will involve me demonstrating that I am capable of performing research. The best way to show this is by pointing to a list of publications that have had some impact in the community (aka citations).<br />
<br />
So how do I make sure that I'm always working towards a publication? Well my process is very much a work in progress, but here it is:<br />
<br />
<h2>
1. Write every day</h2>
I know, I know, that's what everyone says. But there is a reason: <i>it really helps!</i>&nbsp;Write something every day. Write out your data collection process, or some background information and related research. Just put some words down every day. This way, when deadlines start creeping up, you aren't starting at square one with a blank page. You'll have something to work with. It will probably need a lot of editing to be ready for submission, but that's OK.<br />
<h2>
2. Keep a lab journal</h2>
This ties into the first point, but I recently started a lab journal where every day, I record any experiments I run, results I get, or other lab-work related events. This way I have a record of what I did and when I did it, so when I am putting together papers (during my daily writing session) I can reference back to the lab journal instead of trying to remember what happened.<br />
<h2>
3. Set fake deadlines</h2>
I've had mixed results with this one, but I'll include it anyways. When I have a deadline that really motivates me to get stuff done. But if I use a conference deadline as my own deadline, that won't give me enough time to get feedback on a paper from my advisor and co-authors. So I'll set a deadline of 2 weeks before a deadline that I have to have a paper in my advidsor's hands for review. That way we have enough time to edit, run a few more experiments, and get the paper in a much better state than I alone would have been able to do.<br />
<h2>
4. Discover your own structure</h2>
Now, of course there's more to a Ph.D. than writing papers. Getting a Ph.D. is a great opportunity to learn new things and interact with very smart people. But at the end of the day your output during your time in grad school will be papers, and if you want to write papers you need a structure in place to do so. It doesn't have to look like mine, but it should be some combination of habit, accountability, and structure so that the burden doesn't fall on you to remember to get everything done.<br />
<br />
That's it! I use this process to make sure I'm staying on top of what's important: making sure my research is being put out into the academic community. Since I started this process I've definitely been writing more. My conference deadlines start rolling around in December so we'll see if this structure translates into results then.
