title: On a Growing Family
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/05/on-growing-family.html)*.

Our family has a lot going on right now. All good things, but a lot. Baby #2 is due in July, and with that comes a whole lot of new needs for the family. Double strollers, minivans (?), MORE DIAPERS!! We have a lot to think about, a lot to talk about, and a lot of decisions to make.<br />
<br />
This second pregnancy has felt different than the first one, and I think a big part of that is neither my wife nor I are as nervous this time around as last time. When Baby #1 was on her way, I know I was a wreck. I was convinced that I wouldn't be prepared enough, ready enough, or somehow "dad" enough to take care of her when she was born. But you know what? Turns out I was. I like to think that I've been doing ok with the whole dad thing. This time around I am definitely much calmer, but I've been trying to not be too complacent. Baby #2 is going to be so loved it isn't even funny, but I want to make sure that I don't take for granted that there was a huge amount to learn going from zero kids to one kid, and there is probably an equally huge amount to learn going from one kid to two. I can't just assume that since Kid 1 is doing great then all is roses and Kid 2 will be the same. If Kid 2 is anything like her uncle (my younger brother who was #2 in our family), then we will have our hands full.
