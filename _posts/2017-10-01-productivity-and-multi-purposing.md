title: Productivity and Multi-Purposing
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2017/10/productivity-and-multi-purposing.html)*.

Some people just seem <i>so</i>&nbsp;productive. It seems like they always have a new paper out, or blog post, or code repository, or... You get the idea. For a while this bothered me. These individuals are so much more productive than I am, does that mean that I'm not productive enough? Am I not doing enough? After I thought about it some more I realized that these people are more often than not the top of the top of their respective classes with regards to their productivity. For every person I see online pumping out blog posts and code repos, there are a lot more people out there that are not. The "active on the internet" group is very active because they choose to be. They've made a commitment to their online identity to make sure that they are getting their work out there for the world to see. Which is great! But it isn't the only way to be productive as a Ph.D. student.<br />

One thing that I have learned, though, is that there are a lot of opportunities to repurpose work into different mediums. If I'm working on a manuscript, why not distill the core ideas into a blog post, to make sure that the message and the story of the research is clear? If I have some code that was tangentially useful for a research project, why not package it up and put it on GitHub? In fact, this blog post was adapted from an entry in my journal.
