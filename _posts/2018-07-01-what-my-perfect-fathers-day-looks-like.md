title: What my perfect Father's Day looks like
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/07/what-my-perfect-fathers-day-looks-like.html)*.

The guys at the HeyDad podcast (https://heydad.com/pages/podcast) recently talked about what their perfect Father's Day would look like. Below is mine.<br />
<br />
Wake up around 5:30 or 6, get a fresh cup of coffee, and read for an hour or so.<br />
When everyone else gets up, have breakfast and take the dog for a nice long walk.<br />
Spend the rest of the morning either at a park or playing in the backyard until lunch.<br />
Then of course, is epic nap time. During the nap my wife and I would just hang out.<br />
In the afternoon, go to some kind of sporting event. That could be one that my kid is participating in (and I or my wife is coaching) or to a stadium for a baseball game.<br />
Dinner would be steaks on the grill, then we'd watch a little bit of Moana before bedtime.<br />
After the kids are asleep, my wife and I would watch a movie and look at each other lovingly.<br />
Bonus: wake up early the day after Father's day and go golfing.<br />
<br />
That sounds amazing to me.
