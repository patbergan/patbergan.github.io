title: Levels of Prioritization
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/03/levels-of-prioritization.html)*.

I have too many projects. For my research, I always find myself with 2 or 3 projects in progress at once. On top of this there is mentoring, reviewing, oh and I'm still taking a class. It's all great stuff, but it's a lot, and sometimes it's hard to keep track of it all. I try to prioritize to-dos for a given week, and when I have a list of things to get done in a given day, I always try to do the hardest thing first. That way I can't put it off. But what I've noticed recently is that even when I do hard things first, I don't necessarily do hard things early. As in early in the week. So I end up with Fridays that are jam packed with important things because I (sub-consciously or consciously) pushed the important things to late in the week because I didn't want to do them!<br />
<br />
From now on I'll try to do the hard things early in the day and early in the week. This will almost certainly involve better planning on my part, so that I can schedule the week in advance and hold myself accountable to that schedule.<br />
