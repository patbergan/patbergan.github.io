title: Lessons from Dad
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/06/lessons-from-dad.html)*.

We just passed Father's Day, and to celebrate it this post is going to go through three key lessons that I've learned from my own Dad. This is certainly an incomplete list, but these three lessons are practical and generalize well. Hopefully you can learn a thing or two from my dad.<br />
<h2>
1. When you're working, work</h2>
My dad is a carpenter. He works with his hands day in and day out. That also means that he could be at one of a number of job sites on any given day, and he doesn't need a laptop or other computer as part of his daily job responsibilities. One upside of this is that it's basically impossible for him to procrastinate on the internet during the job. When he's on the job, he works. That's basically the end of it. And when I worked with my dad during my college-year summers, I was the same way. The work day started, and we worked. Until the work day ended. But now that I spend most of my work day at a desk, staring at a screen, I find it too easy to just check social media or check the news and lose half an hour or more. It comes down to a change in mindset. When you clock in for work at the beginning of the day, commit to working, and try to at least significantly limit the number of times you switch to the news or social media. That stuff will be there after you clock out.<br />
<h2>
2. Do the job right, and until it's done</h2>
A key part of my dad's profession is building things, not surprisingly. Whether it's a new desk for a house, replacing windows, or repairing old flooring, most of my dad's work involves combining labor and materials to produce some result, and once that is done, it's done (barring future repairs or replacements). Contrast this with research or software development. In research, there is the "done-ness" of a paper submission, where once it's out the door, the work you've done up to that point is all that matters in terms of getting the submission accepted. However if the paper is not accepted, then this job re-opens and you have to keep working at it to improve the work and it's chances of being accepted at the next submission venue. With software development, if you release a product, or an app, or a website, that's where the work starts. Even if the work is accepted, you probably have several ideas for extensions to the work that will drive the decisions you make moving forward. Once it's out there, customers will have feedback, find bugs, and make other suggestions that drive the road-map for upcoming work.<br />
<br />
I don't think the research/software development workflow is a bad thing (partly because it's my thing), but there is something to be said for being able to build a thing, build it well, and then leave it and move on to the next thing. You're not constantly thinking about that last thing, and you can focus your time, energy, and attention on the task at hand. Two key considerations here are that 1. You build the thing well, so that you can be confident in its outcome, and 2.&nbsp; After a while, you get a good sense of how long a certain thing takes to build, so you can budget your days well.<br />
<br />
These two things very much go hand in hand. If you know your day, and the number of things you want to get done that day, then you won't be surprised when you look up at 5 and realize that the day is gone and you've gotten nothing done. And if you are careful in your craft and build your thing well, you won't have to stay late to fix mistakes, nor will future you be interrupted in their work to come back and fix your mistakes.<br />
<h2>
3. Know Thyself</h2>
My dad likes to do stuff around the house. I mean that in a very general sense. If something is broken, he'll try to fix it before calling someone. If something needs to be bought or upgraded, he'll do the research needed (or try to before calling me) before making an informed decision about what to do. But he knows his limits. If the toilet is backed up and needs to be snaked, he calls a pro. If the family needs a new TV or laptop, he calls me. And the thing that stands out to me most: he has an accountant to take care of the family's finances. I've known this for a while but only recently thought about it. My dad doesn't like to hand off anything to anyone, but he has given the responsibility of the family finances to an outside professional, who has much more experience with taxes and is in a much better position to make sure things were being done as they should be. This was really eye-opening and showed me that it is important to know where your strengths and weaknesses are, and to get help in your areas of weakness if you need it.<br />

Wrapping Up</h2>

Like I said to start, these are certainly not the only three things I've learned from my dad over the years. He has taught me so much, so in honor of Father's Day I hope you also learn a thing or two from him.</div>
