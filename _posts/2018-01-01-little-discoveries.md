title: Little Discoveries

One of my favorite parts about being a dad are the "little discoveries" that happen as our daughter grows up. Every once in a while the Mrs. and I will think we have everything figured out about what our daughter can and cannot do, then all of a sudden we get a shock. The most recent example was about Matching. The Mrs. was playing with our daughter and was just showing her cards that were around. She got the idea to see what would happen if she tried to introduce matching. Turns out our daughter already has that down pat! She matched every pair the Mrs. threw at her.<br />
<br />
This might sound minor, but as our daughter gets older, there are things like this that happen regularly, where she goes from not knowing how to do something to just <i>knowing</i>&nbsp;how to do it. It's amazing to see her pick up these skills, and it keeps me on my toes to make sure I'm prepared for whatever the next thing she learns is.
