title: Making Things Difficult

I've come up with a system that has probably been explored countless times already, but it's new to me so ease up, okay? I call it "Make ____ Difficult." You fill in the blank with something that you want to stop doing. For example, I have a really tough time at work with procrastination. I am very good at crawling through the internet for hours, reading blog posts and news articles that I really don't need to read. So I'd like to "Make Procrastinating Difficult."<br />
<br />
How would I do that? The solution I've come up with is to remove the internet as a distracting factor when I need to get work done. If I need to write, use pen and paper. If I need to read new papers, print them out beforehand and read them offline. In both cases, I don't even turn my laptop on. This way I can focus entirely on the task at hand without the call of the internet pulling me away. I tried this out last week and I have to say it went well. I wrote for an hour for a paper with an upcoming deadline, and I read three research papers, where on any given normal day I would usually read approximately 0 papers. The new system puts the focus on what really needs to get done, so that I can dedicate time to it and make it happen.<br />
<br />
For our family budget, we're working on "Making Spending Difficult." I think the ease with which we can make credit card purchases leads to decisions that we wouldn't otherwise make with cash. So I'm trying to use cash for most day-to-day purchases (like coffee or lunch) instead of using a credit card. This way I can see the cash leaving my wallet, and if I need to go to an ATM I know that I've already spent a wad of cash to get to that point. If we can make spending a little more difficult I think we'll be able to reduce spending in some areas so that we can do a better job of managing our budget.<br />
<br />
Now, one other thing I need to make difficult is "eating." Right now eating is too easy. There is always food available for me, and I always take it. So, I need to come up with a plan to Make Eating Difficult. I'm still working on this one, so stay tuned.
