title: It's the Holiday Season
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2017/12/its-holiday-season.html)*.

The beginning of December marks the beginning of a Crazy Month of Travel (CMT) for our family. We're traveling for a wedding tonight, we have family coming in to town next weekend, then we leave on a road-trip to visit my wife's family for Christmas (a LOT of round trip driving hours for that one). Snuggled right in between all of the travel, I have a research conference deadline. So I'll need to complete and submit a paper on my research in between driving to and fro basically every weekend this month.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I am beyond excited for all of the travel, and getting to see our family and friends. I'm just going to need to buckle down and make sure I am productive with my work time so that this paper is as good as it can be before I submit it in the middle of the month.<br />
<br />
I'm excited/nervous for the last phase of CMT, namely the road trip to see the in-laws. We'll be packing up our daughter and our dog in a rental car and driving halfway across the country. It's going to be a longggggg trip, and I'm expecting some resistance from our baby girl when she hits hour 4 (I'm being a little generous here) of sitting in her car seat. We need to do some planning before that trip to make sure we have books, snacks, and games to keep her occupied while we head west.
