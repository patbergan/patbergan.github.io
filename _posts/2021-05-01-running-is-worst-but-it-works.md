title: Running is the worst. But it works.

<p>&nbsp;On January 1, 2020 I stepped on the scale. It showed me a big number. Bigger than it had ever been. 270. That was a first. A wakeup call. I had been ignoring my weight for a number of years, with all kinds of excuses. Kids, thesis, job search. And on and on and on. But for whatever reason that number really woke something up in me. It was time to get to work. At the end of 2020, I stepped on the scale again. 235. 35 pounds down in 2020. I've lost a few more pounds since then but 2020 was the big weight loss year. How did I do it?&nbsp;</p><p>Running</p><p>I HATE running. With a passion. I'd call myself relatively athletic, but my type of athletic has always been of the "move heavy things short distances" variety. Running has never been my thing. But last year I decided to get off of my can and start logging miles. This was inspired by a book I read, which basically boiled running down to "Do it. Stop complaining, just run." So I did. At first it was very hard. A mile here, 1.5 miles there. Sore knees, no air in my lungs. But slowly but surely, and with a lot of fits and starts, I was working my way up to 2 miles, 2.5 miles, 3 miles, and eventually 4+ miles per run. And as I ran, the weight started to come off. Alongside the running, I found that I was eating healthier too. But it wasn't always by explicit planning. It was more of healthy eating by osmosis. If I had a bad day eating-wise, my run the next day was miserable. So I ended up eating more healthy food more regularly so that I didn't hate myself (as much) during my runs.&nbsp;</p><p>Running for me has had two big benefits: the first obvious one is the weight loss. Second, I now have a regular running routine. I run 4+ miles at least three times a week. If I don't go for runs I feel terrible. When I run I feel better, my fitness is of course way up. And I enjoy the routine of it. I still very much do not like the running part of running, but everything around it has gotten much more enjoyable. The benefits outweigh the negative parts of the first half mile or so. So I expect that this whole running thing will continue to be a big part of my fitness routine moving forward.</p>
