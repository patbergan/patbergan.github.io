title: Lent 2021

<p>&nbsp;Long time, no see! As you can imagine, a few things have been going on around here. Covid, new baby, work, and everything in between. But now is time to get back on the horse, so to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>We are right in the middle of Lent. For this year I've given up coffee. I did this last year as well, it was very difficult, but I made it through. I'm also doing a few positive things during Lent. I've started praying a daily Examen from St. Ignatius and his Spiritual Exercises. I'm also setting a new goal for myself: go to daily Mass more often. On days when I am at my office, I am lucky enough to have a few daily Mass options available to me (perks of working at a Catholic university). So, on the days when I'm working on campus, I'll attend Mass.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm keeping this short and sweet. I really just wanted to get something out since it has been a while. My goal is to get back to roughly weekly posts. Stay tuned!</p>
