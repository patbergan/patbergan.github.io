title: The Family Adds a New Member
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-family-adds-new-member.html)*.

Hello! It's been a bit of a hiatus, but as you'll soon read, there's been a lot going on with our family. I spent this summer at a great company on an internship (which led to a full time job offer) and we welcomed baby #2 to the family! Needless to say, it's been busy around here.<br />
<h2>
Working man</h2>
The nice thing about my field is that there are a of of companies looking for people who do what I do. So a lot of grad students will spend the summers working at big companies on internships. The hope is that those internships turn into full time job offers when it comes time to graduate. But the short term upside is that those companies often pay really well. Like way better than the grad student stipend you get during the year. So the internship is also a great way to supplement your income without having to spend too much time during the school year on things unrelated to your research. My internship went really well. This was my second summer at the company, and I guess they liked me because at the end of it I got an offer for a full time position.<br />
<h2>
New addition</h2>
As I mentioned, we had another baby, and that has been an amazing experience so far. Completely different than from when our first was born, but still amazing. It's crazy to see how different my wife and I are with #2 than with our oldest. We're much more confident in ourselves as parents, and we're much more confident in our decisions regarding #2 as well. With our oldest, Every time she looked like she might cry, I convinced myself that Child Services were on their way to look disapprovingly at the horrors I was inflicting on my child and take her away. With #2, I know when she's tired, when she's gassy, and when she really just wants to shriek a little. And even better, I (usually) know what to do to help her. I should say that this all goes doubly for my wife, who is a saint.<br />
<h2>
Next time</h2>
Now that we've got two keeping us busy, the whole juggling of responsibilities as a dad and a grad students is getting turned up to 11. On top of that, I'm in the home stretch, which means I need to apply for academic jobs, defend my dissertation proposal, then write the thing. Gonna be a lot of stuff happening here that I can write about. So stay tuned. First up: "why it is unreasonable to try to submit a paper to a conference one month after you have a baby, and why it took longer than it should have for me to reach that conclusion."
