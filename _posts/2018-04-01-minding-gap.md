title: Minding the Gap

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/04/minding-gap.html)*.

It's been four weeks since my last post. April has been pretty hectic, with a sick kid, end-of-semester coursework, and of course, having too many in-progress projects that need to get written up before their looming submission deadlines. The first thing to be cut in the mad dash was this blog. Every week Friday rolled around, and every week I thought to myself, "I could update the blog, or I could keep working." Keep working won out each time. And after the first week, the battle was shorter, because once I let the streak break, it was very easy to keep up the new, not-writing-every-week streak. Then after the second week, I looked at the time since I last wrote (two weeks is not, of course, a long time, but in my head it was ages), and thought to myself, "Look at how long its been, I'll never write a blog post again!" And despair came upon me.<br />
<br />
I call this space between the last time you did something and now the Gap, and I've notice it creep up on me not only when I skip a few blog posts, but also when I'm counting my calories. If I miss a week on the blog, I rationalize not blogging after that by citing the Gap. If I don't track all of my calories one day, then I'm much more likely to skip the next day, and the day after, and go cold turkey for a while as the Gap grows longer and longer.<br />
<br />
But you know what? There's a quick and easy (and free!) way to cut off the Gap. Stop whatever you're doing and eliminate the Gap. If you can just get the next iteration of the thing that fell behind done ASAP, the Gap vanishes. And you're back on track, just like that. So here is my blog post to eliminate my Gap.
