title: New Year's Resolutions
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/01/new-years-resolutions.html)*.

We're back! We spent the holidays with my in-laws and had a wonderful time. I'm happy to report that our Crazy Month of Travel in December all went incredibly well. Preparation and execution of the cross-country road-trip is worth a post of its own.<br />
<br />
Today I'm putting my New Year's Resolutions out there. These are really goals for the year. This is part accountability, part reference. Maybe you see some inspiration here, or maybe you have some tips for me on how to stick to one of my resolutions.<br />
<h4>
Goal #1: Drop 20 Pounds by July</h4>
So this one has two piece to unpack. Obviously, since it's the New Year weight loss is on my mind. When our daughter was born, I put on some weight and haven't been able to get rid of it. So I really want to make losing weight a priority. Getting down to a health weight is important for not only me but the whole family.<br />
<br />
Why July, you may be wondering? Well...that's when baby #2 is due to join the family!! That's right, coming July is the newest addition to the Dad, Ph.D. family! We are beyond excited for it, and the new arrival puts my need to lose weight into a sharper focus. I can't afford to be at my current weight and expect to keep up with two kids. And I <b>definitely </b>can't afford to put on a new round of baby weight. So this goal is my #1 priority.<br />
<h4>
Goal #2: Write. Every. Day.</h4>
I'm a Ph.D. student. One of my top priorities for graduation is to demonstrate evidence of research ability. The best way to make that demonstration is by publishing my research. In order to publish the research, I need to write it down. Right now I do not have a good habit of writing established, and it hurts my progress as a Ph.D. student. I conduct experiments, read research papers, and think about new directions, but don't <i>write it down</i>. And it gets forgotten, or put to the side, never to see the light of a research conference.<br />
<br />
That isn't a sustainable practice if I want to be successful in my field. I wrote before about establishing a daily writing habit, but frankly I haven't kept up with my own advice. This year I'm setting a goal of writing every day. No matter what. No excuses. Even if it's a word or a paragraph or whatever, put words down each and every day.<br />
<h4>
Goal #3: No Publication without Replication</h4>
I'm making a pledge to myself this year: I will not submit a manuscript for publication without providing to the reviewers&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;of the resources necessary to replicate the results described in the manuscript. I am in a computational field, so my work involves a lot of code. By providing code with my submissions, I hope to accomplish three things:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Move reproducible research forward (it's good for the field)</li>
<li>Make my submissions more appealing to the reviewers. By giving them the means to recreate the results they can have confidence in the work.</li>
<li>Personal accountability. Forcing myself to provide the code with the manuscript will require me to have much better processes in place around how I write my code, how I conduct my experiments, and how I store results. Right now everything is very ad hoc, so this will hopefully lead to a more structured research process where experiments can be run repeatedly with a single script, and results are stored in a timestamped fashion so that they can be referenced and exported easily.</li>
</ol>
<h4>
That's It</h4>

Well, that's not exactly it. I have some other goals in mind for this year, but these are definitely the Big Three. Happy New Year!!</div>
