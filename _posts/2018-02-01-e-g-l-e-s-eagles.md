Last weekend, the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl for the first time ever. Even if you aren't a football fan, Super Bowl LII was an incredibly exciting game. Me and the Mrs. went to Philly to watch the game with my family, and let me just say it was an incredible experience. To be able to watch the Eagles win a championship with my family was something else.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about our daughter, and what sports teams she'll like. My hope is that she's a die-hard Philly fan like her old man, but the Mrs. isn't from Philly. She's from Chicago, and her loyalties lies there.&nbsp; Plus, there's the question of where we're going to live and raise our family. Wherever we end up, our daughter's friends will probably support the local team, so she may want to as well. So what do we do?<br />
<br />
I think the best answer is: Whatever she wants. If she wants to cheer for the local team, that's fine. And is she wants to cheer for Chicago teams like her Mom, that's also fine. But you can be certain that she'll know all about this Eagles team, the Phillies of 2008, the Villanova Wildcats, and all of the stories and memories I have of Philly sports. I love these teams, and I can only hope that she will too. But at the very least, if she's a sports fan, then we can at least trash talk each other.
