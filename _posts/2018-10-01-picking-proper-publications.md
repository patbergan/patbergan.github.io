title: Picking Proper Publications
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2018/10/picking-proper-publications.html)*.

This post is going to deal with publication planning. It is somewhat specific to Computer Science, but the ideas hopefully are general enough that they're useful.<br />
<h2>
Travel-Dependent Publication</h2>
When it comes time to plan out a research project, at some point you have to consider where the research will end up. Eventually the results will be written up and presented to the world in the form of a publication. Different areas of scholarship do publications differently, but for Computer Science there are two popular venues: journals and conferences. The trend recently (particularly in areas like machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing) is to publish in the proceedings of annual conferences. Alongside the conferences are topic-specific workshops for works in progress or specialized topics. Both of these types of publications require that you travel to the location of the conference to present the work. So there is an additional layer of responsibility on top of actually writing the paper and getting it published: thinking about where you'll have to go (and when) to present the work when/if it is published.<br />
<br />
This travel requirement is not something that I originally thought about when I submitted my first few papers. I assumed that if the paper got in I would just go wherever the conference was whenever it was to do my presentation. However with a wife and two kids in the mix, one can't simply up and go to every conference that runs each year. For my particular area of research, there are 3 major conferences, 3 somewhat-related conferences, and 2 pretty-related conferences each year. That's 8 conferences, each roughly one week long. Needless to say, I'm not going to be going to all of them.<br />
<br />
What I can do, though, is be intentional about how I plan my publication schedule. If I have one project ready for a full write-up and submission, I can try to bundle that with a work-in-progress, and submit both to a single conference: the full paper to the conference and the work-in-progress to a relevant workshop that is running at the conference. That way I get to attend and present my work as well as get feedback on some new research. That feedback will be helpful when it comes time to submit that to a conference as a full paper (hopefully with some new work concurrently submitted to a workshop at the conference). This plan should help to reduce some of the stress from both ends: the stress of not knowing where to submit a paper and the stress of too much travel piling up and putting pressure on my wife while I'm away.
