*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://thedadphd.blogspot.com/2019/03/home-field-advantage.html)*.

I feel like I need to preface this post by stating the obvious: I love my parents and I love my in-laws. They are the best, they love their grandkids, and they are very, VERY helpful with taking care of the kids.<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
I do my best parenting when I am at my house, and either by myself or with my wife. But really mostly by myself. I don't have a good reason why, but I think it boils down to two things:<br />
<br />
Home field advantage: at our home, I know where everything is, how everything works, and am comfortable with doing just about anything around the house. If we are at my parents' house or my in-laws' house, it's just not the same. That level of comfort at our home means that I don't need to worry when our girls are up to something because they've done it plenty of times before. And I know that if I need something, I can find it very quickly and be back in a flash before our youngest (who is 8 months old) decides that she needs to pull herself up onto something new and less than sturdy.<br />
<br />
Sink or swim parenting: I fancy myself a decent parent. I might even be so bold as to say that I'm pretty good. My wife is home with the girls all day, and is objectively the best person in the world (including best parent). So when we are together with the girls they gravitate to her and she can often read the girls more quickly than I can. That means that I have a little more slack because she is there to run the show. But when it is me and the girls, it's just <i>me and the girls</i>. And that means that I need to be on top of my game in terms of the Three Fs: fun, food, and fancy dress.<br />
<br />
I'll note here that I always strive to be on the top of my parenting game, but when my wife is around and its two parents with two kids, everything is a little (just a teensy tiny bit) easier.<br />
<br />
So between these two things I really am at my best when we're home.
