## The King


### I

Every day I look into her eyes and my heart breaks. Once a year, though, it is so much worse. Once a year, I re-live my daily nightmare in vivid detail.

And I look at my wife, my queen, and see my failure. I failed her. I couldn't protect our family. My daughter.

Green. As green as the jewels in her crown and the fields our farmers tend to to feed the kingdom. Green is still. And the love I see in those eyes knows no bounds.

I know this, and yet my own eyes cannot hold her gaze without seeing our child, our baby, and seeing the empty crib. 18 years ago we both were lost, my queen and I, when our daughter was taken.

We've decided that this year is the last year. Together. We will send up the lights for one last hope that she will see them. And for our people. But we cannot continue.

I cannot live with the pain of seeing my wife lift her lantern to the sky knowing that our daughter won't see it. Hasn't seen any of them.

While we decided together to stop the practice, I alone have decided to stop my rule. Tomorrow morning I will leave, breaking my wife's heart once more.

I've lost my daughter, and I've lost myself. But if I leave now my wife can find herself and be the ruler the kingdom deserves.

### II

He doesn't know that my servants are watching him. Doesn't know that I'm aware of his plans.

My dear husband. My king. 

He hasn't been able to look at me since that day.  And as the years go on my heart has hardened. It's true. But it is against the pain of hope and disappointment that I close off against.

I know he plans to leave. I can't let him. We may never see our daughter again but I will not lose my husband as well.

I've planned something for tomorrow. We lift our lanterns tonight, and we will celebrate with the kingdom tomorrow. A thank you for the 18 years of love as we grieved.

And a promise to them for a brighter future.

### III

She sometimes forgets that I was almost all alone. Before our daughter was born, she almost wasn't. And my queen wouldn't have survived if not for that blessed flower.

That flower saved my life and ended it in turn. Brought me back my wife, and snatched away my daughter.  Snatched away me.

Do I wish the guards hadn't found it? Often, it's true.  But there is no life without my love. My queen. And this pained, broken heart is more than what would be empty without her. 

My queen has planned something. For tomorrow. A feast to celebrate our people. To thank them for standing with us a shouldering our burdens with their own. She must know.

She must have seen me making preparations. Or her servants did. No matter.  If I go in one or three days time it makes no difference. She will still have the rest of her life to heal.

To be happy.

### IV

"Guards! GUARDS!"

I've never heard her sound so scared. I look up. She's running towards the window.

I look. A dark figure. And a shock of yellow. Rapunzel.

No.

Before I can get to her the cloaked figure is gone. And she is gone. We run outside. My queen, our guards. She couldn't have gone far.  She couldn't have gone.

We search throughout the castle grounds. Behind every tree, every wall, every corner. Until the sun comes up. We keep searching. We must find her. I must find her.  For three days I don't sleep.

Five of my best guards collapse from exhaustion.  I'm pushing them too hard. No I'm not. My daughter is missing. We must find her.  I must find her.  Finally, she intervenes.

My wife.

"You must rest, dear."

"I won't lose you too."

Her eyes, so green, full of sadness and longing.  She knows what I know but won't admit she's gone.  Rapunzel is gone. 

### V

It's been almost a year.  The longest of my life. My queen cannot have another child.  Her doctor says the stress of pregnancy would be too much for her. We don't want another child.

We want Rapunzel. I cannot forgive myself for what happened.  I replay that day every night.

How did that cloaked figure get in? How was he undetected? Or she? Was it a handmaiden? The question keeps me up at night.

Every night. 

My queen has an idea.  We should honor Rapunzel on her birthday.  Floating lanterns. Have everyone in the kingdom join us in sending them up.  Join us in remembering our daughter. 

We make our preparations. She planned this to remember, but this could be a signal. Rapunzel could see them.

Wherever she is.  How will she known they're for her?  She must.  Not this year.  Certainly not the next few years.  But when she's older.  Yes. She'll see them, wherever she is, and remember. 

And return to us. 

This is wishful thinking. The delusions of a father driven mad with grief.  But it is all I have. 

And so we make our preparations. 

### VI

It has been 10 years.  Every day my heart breaks again. Every day I look at my wife an beg her forgiveness.  For not being able to keep our daughter safe.

For not being able to keep our daughter here.

The lanterns are a small comfort.  Our people indulge us. Indulge our fantasy that she will one day see them and return to us. 

She will not.

But we cannot stop hoping. 

### VII

It's her. 

It cannot be, but it is. She is the image of her mother.  Those eyes. Her eyes. But the hair. Brown, not blond.  I don't understand.  

I don't care.

She is here. She is home. 

The guards stopped me on my way out.  I had everything in place.  I was packed for a 10 day journey. Just to get as far away as I could, then re-evaluate.

Far enough where people wouldn't recognize my face from their money.

When I met the guard I thought I would have to bribe him.  To buy his silence.  But there was a look in his eye.  A joy. 

An incredulous joy.

"Your Grace..."

"Your daughter..."

"She is returned..."

I pushed past him and ran. I didn't know where she was.  I searched the castle. First our chambers, then the foyer.  But on the portico I saw my wife and...her.

Rapunzel. 

She was home. 

### VIII

She is leaving again. But this time she goes. She is not taken. She goes to join her love, her new husband.  I must give her to him but I do so gladly.  It is her choice.

She was not taken in the dark of night. Instead she goes freely of her own will to the man she loves.  And I couldn't be happier.  She will stay in the kingdom with him.

I will stay too.
